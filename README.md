Multiplayer tetris where everybody gets one button. Best played with 7 friends in the same room.

## How to Play

- Open the spectate page (https://memetris.herokuapp.com/spectate) on a shared screen, like a TV
- Have each person open the game (https://memetris.herokuapp.com) on their phone
- Each player has a single button, and you're all playing the same Tetris instance
- You'll need at least 8 players to actually play (up, down, left, and A for each team)
- If more than 8 players load the game, the extra players will be queued up until someone quits

## Features

- Scoring and game speed are roughly based on the original Tetris
- Music is the "Tetris A" theme from the original game
- Clearing more than 1 line at a time sends garbage lines to the opposing team
